### 🛠️ Final Checklist for a "Perfect" Repo:

1.  **Requirements File:** Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` with these lines:
    ```text
    customtkinter
    Pillow
    reportlab
    ```
2.  **License:** On GitHub, click "Add file" -> "Create new file" -> type `LICENSE`. Choose the **MIT License** template. It's the standard for open-source projects.
3.  **Folders:** Make sure your `core/` and `ui/` folders have an empty file named `__init__.py`. This tells Python they are official packages.



**Would you like me to guide you through the terminal commands (`git init`, `git add`, etc.) to push this to GitHub for the first time?**
